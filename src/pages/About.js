      <p>
      Hi. Iâ€™m Erynn, based in North Carolina.  In 2017, I moved from Southern California to finish my Journalism: Editing and Graphic Design degree at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (yes, I am pretentious enough to write all of that out).
      I'm learning to code. Enjoy my website.
