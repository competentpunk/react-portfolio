## Description

Now that I am about to graduate the full stack coding bootcamp, I want to make a website that not only showcases the challenges and projects I've done throughout this course, but the website itself will be a portfolio piece.


With this site I want users to be able to:
- Learn about me as a person

- View my resume
- Contact me

Additional key elements:
